# MovingWindowRegression
Runs regressions on spatial data in a "window" that moves over the study area  
Inputs are text files exported from ArcGIS, each of which encodes spatial information (a map) of a variable. The variables used in this case were solar energy generation density (dependent variable) and various meteorological, geographical and social features (independent variables). These included solar irradiance, temperature, slope, distance to electrical infrastructure, electricity consumption, and population density, among others. Solar energy generation density refers to the amount of installed photovoltaic capacity per unit area, in megawatts per square kilometer.  
These regressions, plus some standardisation, allowed me to see which factors appeared to be more or less important in different areas- some regression coefficients even changed sign, suggesting a factor could make a positive contribution in one area but a negative one in another. For example, the regression coefficient of population density was positive in the sparsely populated north of Karnataka, where locally lower population density may be associated with insufficient infrastructure for viable grid connection, but negative in the densely populated south, where locally higher density is likely associated with prohibitive land prices.
More information, and outputs, are provided in my dissertation (also in this folder)
