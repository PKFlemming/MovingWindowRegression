# MovingWindowRegression
Runs regressions on spatial data in a "window" that moves over the study area  
Inputs are text files exported from ArcGIS, each of which encodes spatial information (a map) of a variable. The variables used in this case were solar energy generation density (dependent variable) and various meteorological, geographical and social features (independent variables). These included solar irradiance, temperature, slope, distance to electrical infrastructure, electricity consumption, and population density, among others.
